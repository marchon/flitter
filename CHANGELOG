    * Fixed issue: authenticated user should not access signup page.
        Given user is authenticated
        When try to access login, signup, index page
        Redirects user to user's entry page.
    
    * Fixed issue: Invalid string format syntax: 'Welcome, {}'
        Replaced {} with {0}. The former new syntax only works in Python 2.7,
        and will throw error in earlier Python version.
